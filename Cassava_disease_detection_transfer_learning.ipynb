    "# Cassava cultivation is significantly challenged by a variety of plant diseases such as Cassava Bacterial Blight (CBB), Cassava Brown Streak Disease (CBSD), Cassava Green Mottle (CGM), Cassava Mosaic Disease (CMD), which can lead to substantial crop losses. These diseases not only threaten food security but also impact the livelihoods of smallholder farmers who rely on cassava production.  Implementing transfer learning for cassava plant disease detection are essential to sustain cassava production.\n"
