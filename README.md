## Impleamentation of Transfer Learning to detect cassava Disease
# Table of Contents
* Project Overview
Cassava plants are a crucial source of food for millions of people, especially in developing countries. However, they are susceptible to various diseases that can significantly impact yield. This project aims to detect and classify cassava plant diseases using transfer learning, which involves fine-tuning a pre-trained model for the specific task of identifying different cassava diseases.

* Dataset
The dataset consists of images of cassava leaves categorized into the following classes:
Cassava Bacterial Blight (CBB)
Cassava Brown Streak Disease (CBSD)
Cassava Green Mottle (CGM)
Cassava Mosaic Disease (CMD)
Healthy
You can download the dataset from Kaggle
